# MiceProject
This project is contextualized in the Data Science edX course. Specifically, it is the submission for the Capstone Project: IDV Learners section.

There are 4 files: the data set downloaded from kaggle, the PDF report, the RMD file which knits the PDF and the R file which returns the expected results.
